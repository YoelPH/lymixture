# lyMixture

Extension to the [`lymph`] package.

The core idea is to model the different tumor subsites lymphatic metastatic spread in head and neck cancer as a mixture of models as defined in the [`lymph`] package.

This was originally created by [Julian Brönnimann] as part of his Master's thesis in the medical physics research group of Prof. Jan Unkelbach at the University Hospital Zurich.
